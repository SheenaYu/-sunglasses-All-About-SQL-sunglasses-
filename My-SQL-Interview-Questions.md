# Scenario 2

There are four tab delimited files in the dataset:

**table1.txt** : each record corresponds to the cost of treatment for a patient with a specific disease by a specific doctor - a patient can have many diseases - a patient sees only one doctor per disease but may see different doctors for each of their diseases


|patient_id|disease_id|doctor_id|cost|
|---|---|---|---|
|2046|6|25|177|
|30365|2|454|183|
|9100|15|689|111|
|23602|5|312|464|


**table2.txt** : names of the diseases in the dataset


|disease_id|disease_name|
|---|---|
|1|Upper respiratory infections|
|2|Disorders of lipid metabolism|
|3|Sinusitis|
|4|Other arthropathy disorders|
|5|Low back pain|

**table3.txt** : zip codes of the patients in the dataset

|patient_id|patient_zip|
|---|---|
|1|10191|
|2|10270|
|3|10270|
|4|10561|


**table4.txt**: efficiency scores of the doctors in the dataset - the meaning of this score is not relevant to this assessment
You may use any tools available to you to analyze this dataset and answer the following questions.
